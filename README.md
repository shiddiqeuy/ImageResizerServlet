http://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-resize-an-image-in-java/ 


In order to avoid over capacity in server when uploading Images in Asset Management BPM Application ,
I build somekind of web service to resize image size in Java Servlet using JAX-WS Technology and integrate the webservice into main BPM Application .
This web service already implemented in Total E & P Indonesie Production server . 

If you want to learn about this just open my github repo


just copy java files to eclipse/netbeans/another IDE build and deploy to application server 

this java class files are created to be a webservice , so after deploy you can test this web service using SOAP UI
